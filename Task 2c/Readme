1. arena_image(arena_path):
   - Reads an image from the specified path using OpenCV's `imread`.
   - Resizes the image to a fixed size of 700x700 pixels using `cv.resize`.
   - Returns the resized image as a NumPy array.

2. augment_image(image):
   - Enhances image quality through various techniques:
     - Sharpening the image.
     - Reducing noise with Gaussian blur.
     - Performing histogram equalization (for grayscale images).
     - Adjusting brightness and contrast.
   - Returns the augmented image.

3. event_identification(arena):
   - Identifies events in the arena image:
     - Converts the image to grayscale.
     - Applies thresholding to create a binary image.
     - Detects contours in the binary image.
     - Filters contours based on area and aspect ratio.
     - Crops and resizes potential event images.
   - Returns a list of identified event images.

4. classify_event:
   - Classifies the type of event in an image using a pre-trained deep learning model:
     - Loads the model.
     - Preprocesses the input image.
     - Makes predictions using the model.
     - Determines the predicted class and returns the detected event as a string.
