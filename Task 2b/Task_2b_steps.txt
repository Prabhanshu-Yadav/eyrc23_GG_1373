Please write the complete steps taken by your team explaining how you completed Task 2B. It is adviced to be as elaborate as possible.

1. We imported libraries at first of tensorflow and keras
2. Defined the directory path of the dataset, also took the different file extensions list and specified the image size
3. We splited the dataset into train and validation set.
4. One hot encoded the class labels
5. Used a Pre-trained model(resnet model), created a sequential model and freezed the layers 
6. Compiled the model using Adam and used loss function as categorical_crossentropy
7. Trained the model with 10 epochs
8. Saved the model.
